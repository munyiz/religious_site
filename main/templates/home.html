        <p>In light of judging others,Consider Paul. Before he met Jesus,
        he persecuted the church. He stood
        against everyone associated with
        Jesus. He was bound and determined
        to rid the world of this rising sect
        called Christianity. He thought this
        was his duty to God as a Pharisee of
        the Pharisees. He was ready at all
        costs to protect the Jewish way of
        life.
        He showed this as he stood in
        approval watching his Jewish brothers
        stone Stephen to death. After he
        watched Stephen die, he
        strengthened his resolve. He
        escalated his efforts to wreak havoc
        on Christians everywhere. With letters
        in hand authorizing him to arrest
        Christians, he stormed off to
        Damascus.
        You know the story. A bright light
        stopped him dead in his tracks. Jesus
        asked him point blank, "Paul, why
        are you persecuting me?"
        At that moment, Paul knew he had
        been wrong, dead wrong. In both
        word and action, Paul had
        blasphemed God's name. He
        deserved the ultimate punishment.
        He was given something else. Paul put
        it this way in his letter to Timothy: "I
        was shown mercy so that in the worst
        of sinners Christ Jesus might display
        his unlimited patience as an example
        for those who would believe on him
        and receive eternal life" (1 Timothy
        1:16).
        Imagine being in Paul's shoes on that
        road to Damascus. What would you
        expect from the Lord if you had
        done what Paul had done? God's
        unlimited patience brought to Paul
        the mercy he needed. That's love in
        action. Instead of punishment, Paul
        was made alive in Christ.
        Paul grew up wanting to be God's guy.
        He wanted to be a leader for the
        people of God. But he missed the
        boat. Yet, God never deserted him.
        At that critical moment, Jesus
        extended mercy to him. He turned
        this persecutor into a proclaimer, this
        blasphemer into one who would uphold
        the name of Jesus Christ, and this
        violent man into a picture of love
        and grace and mercy. It's no wonder
        Paul began the definition of love with
        these immortal words: "Love is
        patient. likewise these one apears to todays life even though one is a great sinner God changes
        him to someone respectfull and gives him the holy spirit and makes the person a great man in
        his field,these is to indicate that we who are chosen and our sins are washed away we can fear
        nothing for we are the sons of the most high God and. He also handed over to us his word so
        that we will be born again in it</p>
